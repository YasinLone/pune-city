        The Aga Khan Palace is an iconic historical landmark located in Pune, Maharashtra, India. <br>
         Built in 1892 by Sultan Muhammed Shah Aga Khan III, the spiritual leader of the Nizari Ismaili sect, 
         the palace holds significant historical and architectural importance. 
         <br>The palace served as a refuge for the Indian freedom movement leaders who were imprisoned during the Quit India Movement in 1942. 
         <br>Mahatma Gandhi, his wife Kasturba Gandhi, as well as Mahadev Desai and Sarojini Naidu, were among the notable figures who were interned at the palace during this period. Today, the Aga Khan Palace is a museum and memorial dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi and his philosophy of nonviolence. The palace houses various exhibits related to Gandhi's life and the Indian freedom struggle, including photographs, personal belongings, and other memorabilia. Surrounded by sprawling gardens, the palace is a serene and poignant reminder of India's struggle for independence and the enduring legacy of Mahatma Gandhi.
         It stands as a testament to the ideals of peace, justice, and equality that Gandhi advocated throughout his life.
