     <p style="background-color: aqua;">Shaniwar Wada is a historic fortification located in Pune, Maharashtra, India. It was built in 1732 by the Peshwa ruler Baji Rao I, who was the prime minister of the Maratha Empire under Chhatrapati (King) Shahu. The construction of Shaniwar Wada was completed in 1736.

        The fort served as the seat of the Peshwa rulers of the Maratha Empire until 1818 when the Peshwas were defeated by the British East India Company in the Third Anglo-Maratha War. However, in 1828, a fire broke out in the fort which led to significant destruction of the complex. Despite the damage, the fort still stands as an architectural marvel and a prominent historical landmark in Pune.

        Shaniwar Wada is famous for its architectural design, which includes several intricate features such as massive walls, bastions, gates, and a large courtyard. The fort was also known for its elaborate gardens, fountains, and residential quarters for the Peshwa family.
        
        Today, Shaniwar Wada is a popular tourist attraction in Pune, drawing visitors from all over India and around the world. The fort complex has been partially restored, and its ruins serve as a reminder of the rich cultural heritage of the Maratha Empire. Additionally, the fort is reputed to be haunted, with various legends and ghost stories associated with it, adding to its mystique and allure.</p>
